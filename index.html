     <h2>Introduction</h2>   
     <p>Hello everyone!
     <br>My name is Michael Walker, 28 years old, with a lovely wife and four children. I am a qualified electrician and have been working in the elevator industry for about 7 years in various roles (Technical, sales, site management), but the goal is to fully transition into IT within ten years for a variety of reasons including a heavy interest in all things "computer". When the time is available, I enjoy being with my growing family, visiting places with friends here in Brisbane Queensland, or working on never-ending home improvement projects.</p>
     <p>Although I was born in Western Australia and now live in Queensland, you would think I was a Kiwi due to my accent (English speaking only sorry). This is because my family and I lived in a small town called Kawerau in the Bay Of Plenty, New Zealand for fifteen years. It was a lovely little town that kept cleaning up awards for "the most beautiful town" competition to the point that the compitition was eventually cancelled. It did have a dark side to it due to the heavy gang presence (Mongrel Mob, Black Power, Tribesmen etc) and this meant that a street-smart awarness was instilled into me from an early age.</p>
     <p>That being said, many a day was spent swimming in the rivers and lakes close-by and much fun was also had from roaming the town and surrounding bush and forestry, reading in the local library (I was a massive book worm), and helping out in the family business.</p>

                   <h3>Myers Briggs</h3>
                   <div><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/35a3c8d147172">INFJ-A</a>
                   </div>
                   <p>INFJ-A is the rarest personality trait that makes up only 2% of the population and just 1% of men. Each of the four letters of the INFJ code signifies a key personality trait of this type. INFJs are energized by time alone (Introverted), focus on ideas and concepts rather than facts and details (Intuitive), and make decisions based on feelings and values (Feeling). They prefer to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging) although the personal feel is tending more towards “spontaneous and flexible” in nature, and though this trait has been extremely necessary and beneficial throughout childhood and adult life, there is also a desire to be more ordered and structured.

                   <h3>Learning Style</h3>
                   <div>
                     <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=69-64-64&name_key=6c95738ab0">Visual</a>
                   </div>
                   <p>Visual is the primary learing style. Visual style is learning by seeing. You learn visually whenever you gain information from sight. This includes more than just the viewing of pictures and your surroundings because visual learning also encompasses the written word and these learners benefit greatly from teaching that utilizes illustrations, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. They often feel a need to convert spoken instruction into visual form by taking notes.
                   <br>
                   Although the learning style trends more towards visual, it's not by much. Understanding that online tests can be a very good indication, they are to be taken with a grain of salt. The  indicated learning styles are:</p>
                   <ol>
                     <li>Visual      (35%)</li>
                     <li>Kinesthetic (33%)</li>
                     <li>Auditory    (32%)</li>
                   </ol>

                 <h3>Big 5 Personality</h3>
                 <div>
                   <a href="big5/truitybigfivereport.pdf">Openness</a>
                 </div>
                   <p>Demonstrating to be higher than average in Openness, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness but lower than average in Extraversion and extremely low in Neuroticism.
                   <br>Good at establishing and maintaining relationships with a smaller, supportive, interesting, and diverse circle of people. High degree of independence and initiative, and highly capable of quiet, focused thought means that ideas to overcome problems can be novel and creative.
                   <br>
                   Can prefer an individualistic approach to work but enjoys efficient and productive teamwork. This is reflected in the choice of friends as this personality type understands the concept of give-and-take on a deeper level than most. Careers generally tend to be a mix of arts, technology and the sciences but is generally adept at whatever career path is chosen.</p>

                 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                   <p>The tests results above are in depth and created by many talented specialists that have a highly developed understanding of the human sciences. However, these test results, although very accurate, do not tell the full story and can be hit-and-miss in some areas. What they should be used for is to gather a brief, concise understanding of the individual with the knowledge that people change over the course of time and that personality sciences are not concrete evidence when these services are obtained for a small fee online.
                   <br>These results won't overly influence my behaviour in a team as I have been fortunate have gathered real-world experience in team building and leadership situations. Although I work very well in a team, a level of initiative and conscientiousness has seen success and more time spent in leadership or solo activities. While in large teams, it is easy to feel overwhelmed and as a result, the preference is to be involved in small, tightly knit teams of people that understand each other.
                   <br> When forming a team, it is important that diversity of proper thought is embraced. No one is the same as the next, and when people are brought together, the power to accomplish is enhanced.  Team members must be aware that everyone’s strengths and limitations are different and that humility and a tolerance of different opinions is crucial to team success.</p>

   <!-- Interest In IT-->
    <div>
      <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
        <div>
         <p>The interest in IT has always been there I think, from playing games as a kid through to working on programable systems now (and still playing the odd game). I love to know how things work and really love to know how the things I am interested in work! I think cyber security (especially with what’s been happening of late), full stack web development, and infrastructure etc is interesting and wouldn’t mind focusing a bit more on one of those in the future. There is so much I’m unaware of though, for instance software development for businesses, schools, entertainment covers a huge scope and the opportunities for personal expression and creativity while continuing to be a productive member of society and contributing towards, or creating systems, that make our lives better in some way through IT is an exciting idea.
          <br>
         In the meantime, focusing on IT studies and gathering greater exposure to the tools required (computers, audio and visual equipment, text edtitors, compilers etc) is the current game plan.  </p>

   <!-- Ideal Job -->
    <div>
      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
        <div>
          <p>For me, nailing down what the ideal job would be is tricky because I am interested by so many different things. What some broad strokes might be could entail the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Development.</li>
              <li>Customer interaction (preferably B2B).</li>
              <li>Managment.</li>
            </ul></p>
             <p>And not to mention areas such as:
               <ul>
                <li>Health.</li>
                <li>Music.</li>
                <li>Facilities management.</li>
               </ul></p>
               <p>A good reflection of what this might be is this screenshot of advertised job description that I found on Seek.</p>
                <div><img src="ideal_job.jpeg" alt="Job Position Screenshot" style="width:50%"></div>
               <p>Now I am currently a long way from having all the skills necessary and desirable for being able to apply for this kind of position. But what makes it so attractive is the wide skillsets needed. Already, I have good customer relationship building and stakeholder management skills along with skills in multi-tasking in high pressure environments while meeting deadlines, and team leadership but also being able to perform in a solo capacity. Now, if I were to want that exact job, the first step would be to obtain the relevant technical skills. Studying and completing a degree in IT would be a solid base from which one would then branch out into positions that offer (or make use of) the specific skills needed for the above position like cloud application, security, IT integration etc.</p>
               <p>However, it could be entirely likely that the delight in building attractive, functional websites for overjoyed clients might also make itself known. In that case, it would start as a freelancing project and over time be built into a business made up of a team of people.</p>

   <!-- Project Idea -->
       <div>
           <h2>My Project Idea</h2>
           <p><b>Overview</b></p>
           <p>This project idea is going to address management issues with regards to scheduling maintenance activities and service or certification tasks. This idea, being in its infancy and currently only on paper, will take into account the possibility for scalability and flexibility with regards to new ideas that will improve and/or expand its scope or effectiveness.
           The project will be based on a Parent/Child design with a Web Portal/Parent interface used in conjunction with an App/Child on a phone or tablet.
           Simply put, the goal of this idea is to cut time lost to field administration.</p>
           <p><b>Why is this even an idea?</b></p>
           <p>Currently, maintenance schedules for field service technicians are bulky, unintuitive designs that are constantly looked down upon by technicians, almost all of which have great aversion to any form of administration activities that they are required to do. This quite often means that office administration has to spend time and effort to remind their field staff to complete these tasks.
           Another fault that this causes can be seen on my own current field.
           <br>
           I am a field technician in the elevator industry. Due to the niche nature of this industry being mainly occupied by qualified electricians, the wage enjoyed by the service men and women is one of the highest in the electrical field (barring FIFO occupations). This means that employers are relying on highly paid technicians to complete administrative activities usually completed by an office admin team or member. To further this issue, once the field team members complete and submit their paperwork concerning the relevant field tasks, the office admin team usually have to process these submissions further and send/email these completed formworks to their relevant destinations.
           Over time, the costs accrued by companies from these inefficiencies add up. Even with a crew of 4 technicians in the company I work for, the cost the company bears for us to tick and sign the same input fields on almost every maintenance task comes to almost $25,000 AUD a year! And there are multiple crews per state, times multiple states, times three countries. Keep in mind that this doesn’t take into consideration the further processing costs of the company’s service coordination/admin department.</p>
           <p><b>What is going to fix this issue?</b></p>
           <p>There are a lot of apps out there that aim to fill this space and some of them do an ok job (from personal experience and from reading reviews on what I have not experienced), but what none of them do, it seems, is do what WIX did for bloggers that did not fancy using WordPress. What this project aims to accomplish is to create a solution that can be easily employed in a simple, intuitive way that will cut administration costs generated by field team members. This can be done in a number of ways:
           <ul>
            <li>Pre-built templates available.</li>
            <li>Saved technician details, signatures and maintenance tasks that can be filled at the touch of a screen when on-site.</li>
            <li>Auto generated docs that are e-mailed to their relevant locations (eg. Job completion certificate e-mailed to the client).</li>
           </ul>
           The ways that this idea could also uniquely benefit potential users:
           <ul>
            <li>Available to freelance trades or medium sized businesses.</li>
            <li>Video walkthroughs.</li>
            <li>Easy set-up, easy use.</li>
           </ul>
           Initially, this project idea aims to start in a position where it can set its sights on achieving these goals in a methodical process in order for it to start in a feasible manner. Because there is available scope for an endless array of features eg. Contracts, invoicing, calendars, compatibility with other apps, HR management etc, it is important that this project first cover the simple and necessary basics and focus on streamlining these basics.
           It is possible that aiming for a huge scope while still on the starting line may provide such a drawback as to delay project in any sort of progress.
           <br>
           First, an online “main customer hub” or “portal” will be built to accommodate the first objective. This objective will be to:
           <ul>
           <li>Established a website.</li>
           <li>Incorporated login features to access a basic profile or “portal”.</li>
           </ul>
           Secondly, customizable features will be added such as:
           <ul>
           <li>Build portal themes and user branding.</li>
           <li>User profile.</li>
           <li>User portfolio (units on service run, site contact details, maps integration etc).</li>
           <li>Calendar and notifications.</li>
           </ul>
           Lastly, an app that can pull this information for the user and/or push completed tasks or added data (eg. site Facilities Manager changed his phone number, or key box code changed) to the main hub.
           <br>
           What is also going to be important to provide businesses and employers, is the opportunity to exercise control over their account. An example would be found in the employer locking the app so that employees can only submit certain data or use certain functions. This would mean that the employer has peace of mind that no one can accidentally change important information or details about a site/job that could cause un-intended negative consequences (eg. Employee deletes job, or mixes commencement dates etc).
           The ability for an employer to easily create a clean, intuitive, customizable work solution online (using a computer, laptop, netbook, phone etc) and have complete control over how that information is presented to his team via an app will be extremely attractive. Also, being able to cut unnecessary costs by having employees or solo workers in the field complete admin tasks at the touch of a button will certainly be notable and very welcome.
           <br>
           As mentioned before, if this idea is successful in its fulfilment and delivery, the scope of possibilities that can be enabled through proper groundwork will be further explored.
           In addition to simply filling out maintenance or repair schedules, the ability to add functions for quoting or invoicing can be added. An example of this feature would be a tradesperson quickly filling out materials, lengths, quantity, time etc into pre-built fields on the app while onsite and emailing the quote to the customer via a “submit” button to complete the task.
           Or some other options out of the vast variety would be:
           <ul>
           <li>Timing of technician’s attendance.</li>
           <li>Location of devices so employers can prioritise labour for unplanned callouts.</li>
           <li>Media uploads through the app.</li>
           </ul></p>
           <p><b>How is this going to come to life?</b></p>
           <p>Although good ideas are great, the skills and energy to turn ideas into something usable or enjoyable is even better.
           Good website and app development skills will be necessary to build this project along with some artistic skills to help present the completed design in a tasteful, inviting way.
           What will also be vital is the experience and feedback from a target market sample. This will ideally be a tradesperson who also understands small-to-medium business operations. This will greatly help in shaping the finished product into a tool that is made for its market, by its market’s population.</p>
           <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
           <p>If successful, this will provide small-to-medium businesses the ability to vastly reduce the time spent on admin activities by that business’ field members. This in turn will reduce the costs associated while increasing the productivity of the user.
           In time, the ability for businesses to streamline All admin duties, not just for field teams, but also for HR departments, sales teams, accounts etc. of those businesses will also be implemented. </p>
